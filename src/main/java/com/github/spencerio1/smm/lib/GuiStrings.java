It is geared toward adding purposeful stuff to all aspects of the game, especially to the mining and exploring aspects of the game, as well as building, etc. Right now it is the most popular MCreator mod EVER, and has more than 4,850 downloads! It is my first mod, believe it or not, and is much more succesful than my original goals. Have any questions/comments/ concerns? Click one of the buttons below to get to the pages for Spencerio's Mod Mod and post it there. I will respond ASAP.
